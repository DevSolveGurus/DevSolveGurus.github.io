# Challenges encountered when attempting to establish a connection to a remote machine using Spyder in Python

I have a RedHat System running Spark on top of HDFS within an AWS environment. My objective is to access PySpark interactively from my local machine. To achieve this, I installed Spyder-Py2 with the intention of connecting it to the remote AWS machine.

Here's the process I followed:

1. Utilizing the 'Connecting to a remote kernel via SSH' method described in the Cookbook, I initiated a kernel on the AWS machine (referred to as the 'Server') and then copied the JSON configuration file to my local machine.

2. I modified the 'kernel1234.json' file to specify the public IP address.

3. In Spyder-Py2, I navigated to the Consoles section and chose 'Connect to existing kernel.'
4. I provided the 'kernel1234.json' file, along with the username and host information in the appropriate fields.

5. I also supplied my AWS PEM key in the SSH Key section and entered the password.

Unfortunately, this process resulted in the following error:

```
Unable to connect to IPython kernel-1234.json   
```

I'd appreciate it if someone could help me identify what might be missing in my setup.

Important to note: The server on the AWS VM is still up and running

## The Answer

It looks like you're trying to connect to a remote IPython kernel running on your AWS instance using Spyder-Py2, but you're encountering an error. Let's troubleshoot the issue step by step:

#### 1.Check SSH Configuration:

Ensure that SSH is correctly configured on your AWS instance and that you can connect to it using SSH.

```bash
ssh -i your-aws-key.pem ec2-user@your-aws-ip
```
If this command connects you to your AWS instance without any issues, then your SSH configuration is correct.

#### 2. Check JSON File:

Verify that the **kernel1234**.json file has the correct IP address of your AWS instance. Open the file and ensure the **"ip"** field is set to your AWS instance's public IP address.

```json
{
    "ip": "your-aws-ip",
    "key": "your-key",
    ...
}
```

#### 3. Check Username:

Verify the correct username for your AWS instance and use it in the hostname section when connecting in Spyder-Py2. For example, if your username is **ec2-user**, the hostname should be **ec2-user@your-aws-ip**.

#### 4. SSH Key Permissions:

Make sure the permissions on your PEM key file are set correctly:

```bash
chmod 400 your-aws-key.pem
```

#### 5. Firewall Rules:

Ensure that the security group or firewall rules on your AWS instance allow incoming SSH connections on port 22 from your local machine's IP address. You can configure this in the AWS console.

#### 6. Kernel Status on AWS Instance:

On your AWS instance, verify that the kernel is running. You can do this by checking the list of running processes. You should see a Python process associated with the kernel.

```bash
ps aux | grep python
```

#### 7. Spyder Configuration:

In Spyder, when connecting to the existing kernel, use the following settings:

1. Kernel file: Path to the **kernel1234.json** file.

2. Username: Your AWS instance username **(e.g., ec2-user)**.

3. Hostname: The public IP address of your AWS instance **(e.g., your-aws-ip)**.

4. SSH Key: Path to your PEM key file **(e.g., your-aws-key.pem)**.



#### 8. Connection Timeout:

Ensure you have a stable internet connection, as network issues can cause timeouts. Reattempt the connection after verifying all settings.

#### 9. Logs and Error Messages:

If you encounter any specific error messages, please share them for more targeted assistance.

#### 10. Alternative Approaches:

If you continue to face issues, consider alternative methods like using Jupyter Notebook with remote kernels or SSH tunneling to access Spark's web interfaces and Jupyter Notebook on your AWS instance.

By following these steps and checking each point carefully, you should be able to successfully connect to the remote IPython kernel on your AWS instance using Spyder-Py2.
